# RFP Proposal: Node Load Balancer

**Name of Project:** Node Load Balancer (NLB)

**RFP Category:** `devtools-libraries`

**Proposer:** [@realchainlife](https://github.com/realchainlife)

# Project Description

Once data has been imported into a Filecoin node, users typically propose a storage deal by looking through available ask orders 
from miners and manually choosing one. The NLB will function as a utility library which will perform node various node operations using multiple nodes instead of a single node provider.



## Deliverables

- An open-sourced, dual-licensed (under MIT and APACHE2) library that uses a hash-based algorithm for traffic distributions and can be used modularly by other software projects in the Filecoin ecosystem
	- Can be in any language, but we have a preference for Go, JS and Rust
- Documentation of how to use and install this library
- Sample application (can be extremely simple) that consumes this library as a dependency along with another Filecoin module
- Well-documented, human-readable codebase

## Development Roadmap

Please break up your development work into a clear set of milestones. You can use the milestones suggested in the RFP or create your own. This section needs to be very detailed (will vary on the project, but aim for around 2 pages for this section).

For each milestone, please describe:
- The software functionality that we can expect after the completion of each milestone. This should be detailed enough that it can be used to ensure that the software meets the RFP scope.
- How many people will be working on each milestone and their roles
- The amount of funding required for each milestone
- How much time this milestone will take to achieve (using real dates)

## Total Budget Requested

Sum up the total requested budget across all milestones, and include that figure here. Ensure that it does not exceed the total funding limit on the RFP.

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

Specify your team's long-term plans to maintain this software and upgrade it over time.
